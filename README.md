# Applied-Machine-Learning

In Fall 2024 of the MS Data Science program, I took a course called Applied Machine Learning. Given features derived from images of breast masses, my team and I built and trained machine learning models to accurately diagnose cancers as malignant or benign.

The folder structure is as follows:
	1. AML_Final_Project_Report_Final_Draft.pdf
		a. A pdf containing our final report. 
		b. We structured our report to include:
			(i) Background & Data Context
			(ii) Preprocessing
			(iii) Models
			(iv) Model Results
			(v) Conclusions
	2. Applied_ML_Final_Proj_Deliv3.ipynb
		a. A .ipynb notebook containing all of our code.
		b. Includes the following:
			(i) EDA and preprocessing
			(ii) Model Implementations
			(iii) Hyperparameter Tuning
			(iv) Model Evaluations
			(v) Data Visualizations

To reproduce the results from our report, you can execute all the code cells in Applied_ML_Final_Proj_Deliv3.ipynb
