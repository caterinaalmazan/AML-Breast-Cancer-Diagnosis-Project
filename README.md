# Columbia University: Breast Cancer Diagnosis using Machine Learning, Applied Machine Learning

In Fall 2024 of the MS Data Science program, I took a course called Applied Machine Learning. Given features derived from images of breast masses, my team and I built and trained machine learning models to accurately diagnose cancers as malignant or benign.


•	Built and trained machine learning models to accurately diagnose & predict breast cancer cysts as malignant or benign

•	Performed hyperparameter tuning on Logistic Regression, Random Forest & XGBoost for evaluation using F1-score

•	Leveraged EDA techniques to understand underlying structure of data; identified key trends, anomalies, & hypotheses

•	Led team of five researchers – coordinating work sessions, final paper documentation, and technical project timeline


The folder structure is as follows:

	1. AML_Final_Project_Report_Final_Draft.pdf
		a. A pdf containing our final report. 
		b. We structured our report to include:
			(i) Background & Data Context
			(ii) Preprocessing
			(iii) Models
			(iv) Model Results
			(v) Conclusions
	2. Applied_ML_Final_Proj_Deliv3.ipynb
		a. A .ipynb notebook containing all of our code.
		b. Includes the following:
			(i) EDA and preprocessing
			(ii) Model Implementations
			(iii) Hyperparameter Tuning
			(iv) Model Evaluations
			(v) Data Visualizations

To reproduce the results from our report, you can execute all the code cells in Applied_ML_Final_Proj_Deliv3.ipynb
